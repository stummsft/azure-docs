# What is automated machine learning?

Automated machine learning, also referred to as AutoML, allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. 

Automated ML builds a set of ML models automatically, intelligently selecting models for training and then recommends the best one for you. Traditional machine learning model development is resource-intensive requiring significant domain knowledge and time to produce and compare dozens of models. With automated ML, you'll accelerate the time it takes to get production-ready ML models with great ease and efficiency.

Behind the scenes, your training data is taken with a defined target feature, and intelligently iterated upon through combinations of ML algorithms and feature selections. Then, based on training scores, the best fitted model is identified and recommended to you. 

You still have control over your experiment and transparency into what is happening. You can define constraints and experiment goals based on time, accuracy, or number of iterations, for example. You can see each model that was generated for your experiment, the training flow for each iteration, and the most influential features for a given model.

## How automated ML works

Using **Azure Machine Learning service**, you can design and run your automated ML training experiments with these steps:

1. **Identify the ML problem** to be solved: classification, forecasting, or regression
   
1. **Specify the source and format of the labeled training data**: Numpy arrays or Pandas dataframe

1. **Configure the compute target for model training**, such as your [local computer, Azure Machine Learning Computes, remote VMs, or Azure Databricks](how-to-set-up-training-targets.md).  Learn about automated training [on a remote resource](how-to-auto-train-remote.md).

1. **Configure the automated machine learning parameters** that determine how many iterations over different models, hyperparameter settings, advanced preprocessing/featurization, and what metrics to look at when determining the best model.  You can configure the settings for automatic training experiment [in Azure portal](how-to-create-portal-experiments.md) or [with the SDK](how-to-configure-auto-train.md).

1. **Submit the training run.**

During training, the Azure Machine Learning service creates a number of pipelines that try different algorithms and parameters. It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment. 

You can also inspect the logged run information, which contains metrics gathered during the run. The training run produces a Python serialized object (`.pkl` file) that contains the model and data preprocessing.


While model building is automated, you can also [learn how important or relevant features are](how-to-configure-auto-train.md#explain) to the generated models.

## Preprocessing

In every automated machine learning experiment, your data is preprocessed using the default methods and optionally through advanced preprocessing.

### Automatic preprocessing (standard)
In every automated machine learning experiment, your data is automatically scaled or normalized to help algorithms perform well.  During model training, one of the following scaling or normalization techniques will be applied to each model.

|Scaling&nbsp;&&nbsp;normalization| Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [StandardScaleWrapper](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html)  | Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance  |
| [MinMaxScalar](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html)  | Transforms features by scaling each feature by that columnâ€™s minimum and maximum  |
| [MaxAbsScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MaxAbsScaler.html#sklearn.preprocessing.MaxAbsScaler) |	Scale each feature by its maximum absolute value |	
| [RobustScalar](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler.html) |	This Scaler features by their quantile range |
| [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) |	Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of the data to project it to a lower dimensional space |	
| [TruncatedSVDWrapper](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD.html) |	This transformer performs linear dimensionality reduction by means of truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). Contrary to PCA, this estimator does not center the data before computing the singular value decomposition. This means it can work with scipy.sparse matrices efficiently |	
| [SparseNormalizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Normalizer.html) | Each sample (that is, each row of the data matrix) with at least one non-zero component is rescaled independently of other samples so that its norm (l1 or l2) equals one |	

### Advanced preprocessing: optional featurization

Additional advanced preprocessing and featurization are also available, such as missing values imputation, encoding, and transforms. [Learn more about what featurization is included](how-to-create-portal-experiments.md#preprocess). Enable this setting with:
+ Azure portal: Selecting the **Preprocess** checkbox in the **Advanced settings** [with these steps](how-to-create-portal-experiments.md). 
+ Python SDK: Specifying `"preprocess": True` for the [`AutoMLConfig` class](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-train-automl/azureml.train.automl.automlconfig?view=azure-ml-py).

## Ensemble models

You can train ensemble models using automated machine learning with the [Caruana ensemble selection algorithm with sorted Ensemble initialization](http://www.niculescu-mizil.org/papers/shotgun.icml04.revised.rev2.pdf). Ensemble learning improves machine learning results and predictive performance by combing many models as opposed to using single models. The ensemble iteration appears as the last iteration of your run.

## Use with ONNX in C# apps

With Azure Machine Learning, you can use automated ML to build a Python model and have it converted to the ONNX format. The ONNX runtime supports  C#, so you can use the model built automatically in your C# apps without any need for recoding or any of the network latencies that REST endpoints introduce. Try an example of this flow [in this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning/classification-with-onnx/auto-ml-classification-with-onnx.ipynb).

## Automated ML across Microsoft

Automated ML is also available in other Microsoft solutions such as:
+ In .NET apps using Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code with [ML.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/automl-overview)
+ [On HDInsight](../../hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-run-machine-learning-automl.md), where you scale out your automated ML training jobs on Spark in HDInsight clusters in parallel. 
+ [In Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-machine-learning-automated)
