# Tutorial: Use Azure CDN to enable a custom domain with SSL for a static website

This tutorial is part two of a series. In it, you learn to enable a custom domain endpoint with SSL for your static website. 

The tutorial shows how to use [Azure CDN](../../cdn/cdn-overview.md) to configure the custom domain endpoint for your static website. With Azure CDN, you can provision custom SSL certificates, use a custom domain, and configure custom rewrite rules all at the same time. Configuring Azure CDN results in additional charges, but provides consistent low latencies to your website from anywhere in the world. Azure CDN also provides SSL encryption with your own certificate. For information on Azure CDN pricing, see [Azure CDN pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cdn/).

In part two of the series, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, complete part one, [Tutorial: Host a static website on Blob Storage](storage-blob-static-website-host.md). 

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to get started.

## Create a CDN endpoint on the static website endpoint

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) in your web browser. 
1. Locate your storage account and display the account overview.
1. Select **Azure CDN** under the **Blob Service** menu to configure Azure CDN.
1. In the **New Endpoint** section, fill out the fields to create a new CDN endpoint.
1. Enter an endpoint name, such as *mystaticwebsiteCDN*.
1. Enter your website domain as the hostname for your CDN endpoint.
1. For the origin hostname, enter your the static website endpoint. To find your static website endpoint, navigate to the **Static website** section for your storage account and copy the endpoint (remove the preceding https:// )
1. Test your CDN endpoint by navigating to *mywebsitecdn.azureedge.net* in your browser.
1. Additionaly verify by navigating to the **New Endpoint** under settings, origin to see if the Origin type is set  to *Custom Origin*
and *Origin hostname* displays the Static webiste endpoint name.

## Enable custom domain and SSL

1. Create a CNAME record with your domain name provider to redirect your custom domain to the CDN endpoint. The CNAME record for the *www* subdomain should be similar to the following:

    ![Specify CNAME record for subdomain www](media/storage-blob-static-website-custom-domain/subdomain-cname-record.png)

1. In the Azure portal, click on the newly created endpoint to configure the custom domain and the SSL certificate.
1. Select **Add custom domain** and enter your domain name, then click **Add**.
1. Select the newly created custom domain mapping to provision an SSL certificate.
1. Set **Custom Domain HTTPS** to **ON**. Select **CDN Managed** to have Azure CDN manage your SSL certificate. Click **Save**.
1. Test your website by accessing your website url.
